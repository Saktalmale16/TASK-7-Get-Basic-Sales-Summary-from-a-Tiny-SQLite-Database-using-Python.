# TASK-7-Get-Basic-Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python. 

Sales Data Analysis with SQLite and Python

Objective

In this project, I used Python along with SQLite, pandas, and matplotlib to perform basic sales analysis. The goal was to connect to an SQLite database, run SQL queries to get sales data (total quantity sold and revenue per product), and

display the results using print statements and a bar chart.

Tools Used

Python (for scripting)

SQLite (built into Python, no setup required)

pandas (for data manipulation)

matplotlib (for creating visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook or Python (.py) file

Dataset

The dataset consists of an SQLite database (sales_data.db) with a sales table containing the following columns:

product: Name of the product

quantity: Number of items sold

price: Price per item

Task Breakdown

Create SQLite Database & Sales Table: I created an SQLite database called sales_data.db and inserted sample data into the sales table. This table contains products, their sold quantities, and their respective prices.
