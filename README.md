# TASK-7-Get-Basic-Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python. 

# 🛒 Sales Data Analysis with SQLite and Python 📊

# 🎯 Objective

In this project, I used Python along with SQLite, pandas, and matplotlib to perform basic sales analysis. The goal was to connect to an SQLite database, run SQL queries to get sales data (total quantity sold and revenue per product), and

display the results using print statements and a bar chart.

# 🛠️ Tools Used

Python (for scripting)

SQLite (built into Python, no setup required)

pandas (for data manipulation)

matplotlib (for creating visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook or Python (.py) file

---
# 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset consists of an SQLite database (sales_data.db) with a sales table containing the following columns:

product: Name of the product

quantity: Number of items sold

price: Price per item

---

# Final Deliverables 🎁 :

Sales Summary: A printed table showing total quantity and revenue for each product.

Bar Chart: A visualization of total revenue per product.

Chart Output: The chart can also be saved as a PNG file (sales_chart.png).

# 💻 Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

sqlite3 (built-in with Python)

pandas

matplotlib

# 🚀 Running the Script
You can run the script either in:

Jupyter Notebook: Run each cell step by step to load data, run SQL queries, print the output, and display the bar chart.

Python (.py file): Save the script as a .py file and run it directly from the terminal.

---
# 📈 Expected Output:
Printed sales summary: Shows the total quantity and revenue per product.

Bar Chart: A simple bar chart displaying total revenue per product.

---
# 🎉 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use SQLite for basic sales data analysis, with Python handling database queries and generating insights through data visualization.
